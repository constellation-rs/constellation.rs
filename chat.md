We aim to create a community that is welcoming and helpful to anyone that is interested! Come join us on [our Zulip chat](https://constellation.zulipchat.com/) to:

 * get any of the Constellation crates working for your use case;
 * discuss direction for the project;
 * find good issues to get started with.

### Zulip

The Constellation Project uses Zulip Chat as a lightweight structured chat platform. Check out the [getting started guide](https://zulipchat.com/help/getting-started-with-zulip) to get up to speed.
