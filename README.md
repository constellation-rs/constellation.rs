# constellation.rs

This is the source of the [Constellation project website](https://constellation.rs) which is generated by jekyll and hosted by GitHub Pages.

To view locally, install the dependencies:
```bash
PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH" bundle install
```

And invoke jekyll to serve it:
```bash
PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH" bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Adjust PATH as appropriate â€“ this happens to work on my macOS system.

To check validity:
```bash
PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH" bundle exec jekyll build
PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH" bundle exec htmlproofer --assume-extension ./_site
```
