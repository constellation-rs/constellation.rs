The Constellation Project is an open source project! If you'd like to contribute, check out the list of [“good first issues”](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aissue+org%3Aconstellation-rs+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). These are all (or should be) issues that are suitable for getting started, and they generally include a detailed set of instructions for what to do. Please ask questions and ping us on [our Zulip chat](https://constellation.zulipchat.com) if anything is unclear!
